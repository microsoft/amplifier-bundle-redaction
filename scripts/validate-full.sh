#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# validate-full.sh — run `validate-bundle-repo` against THIS bundle in FULL mode.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# --------------
# The validator runs its Python checks through a bash `python3` heredoc. In a
# default Amplifier environment that `python3` is a minimal interpreter with no
# `pip` and no `amplifier_foundation` / `hatchling`, so the recipe self-downgrades
# to `validation_mode: structural_only` — it SKIPS the two checks that matter most
# for this repo: BundleRegistry resolution of the behavior include, and the
# library-wheel build check.
#
# This script builds a throwaway uv venv that HAS those deps, puts its `bin` first
# on PATH, and runs the recipe — so the recipe's `python3` resolves to an
# interpreter that can `import amplifier_foundation` and `import hatchling`, which
# flips the run to `validation_mode: full`.
#
# (This is the uv-based equivalent of the recipe's own documented
#  `uvx --with hatchling --with amplifier-foundation amplifier tool invoke ...`
#  one-liner; the venv form is used because the recipe shells out to `python3`,
#  so the deps must live on the PATH `python3`, not just in a uvx tool env.)
#
# USAGE
# -----
#   scripts/validate-full.sh [REPO_PATH]
#       REPO_PATH defaults to this bundle's repo root.
#
# ENV
#   CI_VALIDATE_VENV   override the venv location (default: $TMPDIR/ci-validate-venv)
#
# Requires: uv, and the `amplifier` CLI on PATH, with the amplifier-foundation
# bundle present in ~/.amplifier/cache (it ships the recipe).
